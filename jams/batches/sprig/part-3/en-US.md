# Take Your Sprig Game to the Next Level With Traps, Moving Obstacles, and More.
(this should take two sessions in a club!)

Last session, you built your very own maze game from scratch! (if this isn't true, check out [session 2](LINK AAAA TODO) of this jam!) Today, we'll be expanding on our game by adding various game mechanics, or features. Take a look at the list of examples below, and make note of what seems fun/interesting/inspiring to you!

### List of game mechanics
- Beginning
  - [Keys and locks](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_keylock)
  - [Pushboxes](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_pushbox)
  - [Step limit](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_steps)
  - [Traps](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_traps)
- Intermediate
  - [Portals](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_portals)
  - [Fragile tiles](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_fragile_tiles)
  - [Two player](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_twoplayers)
- Advanced
  - [Moving obstacles](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_moving_obstacles)
  - [Sliding movement](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze_jumps)

During these next two sessions, you'll be choosing two game mechanics to implement in your own game! Choose two of varying difficulty levels, and try your best to figure out how to implement them on your own, but don't be afraid to make use of the hints and those around you! Think about how you can combine different game mechanics to play into a cohesive game, and think about how you can build a story around the ones you choose.
