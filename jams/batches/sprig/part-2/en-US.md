# Make Your Very Own Maze Game With Sprig!
### (tips for club leaders)
Try to make this club session as collaborative as possible! Collaboration and interaction is what makes meetings fun and keeps people coming back.  
Here's some ideas to encourage this:
- Encourage people to ask the people around them from help as a first resort!
- Have everyone design sprites, then pair up with someone else who creates a story and game around it

### Part 2/5 - 45-60 minutes
Last session, you built a push block game in Sprig (if you haven't, check out [part 1](LINK AAAA TODO) of this jam!). Let's build off that experience and make something even more awesome!

*This is a sample of what your base game might look like! I made mine about a watering can who needs to get to a flower, but your game's story, levels, sprites, etc. will be your very own :)*

Today, we'll be learning to make a maze game in Sprig! By the end of this jam, you'll have created your very own maze game from scratch! Next session we'll be adding custom game mechanics and getting ready to share your game with the world! (how exciting is that??)

This jam is organized as a series of steps with not much help at first. Try your best to figure them out using your resources (using the Sprig help, Google, and asking the people around you is all encouraged!) but don't be afraid to use the hints if you need to.

[Click here](https://sprig-nocode.hackclub.dev/maze) for a demo of what you could make today.

TODO: what's the policy on remixes of games getting into the gallery?  
Disclaimer: making a maze game by following this tutorial won't qualify you to get a free Sprig console. However, you can expand on this game to be unique and personalized after finishing this batch jam, or take the skills you gain here to make a unique game later!

## Starting the tutorial
THIS IS TODO; I'm blocked by the Sprig PR being merged for tutorial pane

## Wrap-up!
Congratulations!! By finishing this tutorial, you just made your own game from scratch!

Next session, we'll be adding custom game mechanics to our game! Take a look at the game mechanics list in part 4 for some examples of what you can make.
