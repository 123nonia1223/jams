## Customizing your island üéÄ
Now you know the basics of Spline and have built a mini-house, start making the island your own. Expand your island, build more structures, venture underground‚Äîthe possibilities are endless!

### Spline‚Äôs asset library
Spline has a ***huge*** library of 3D models and scenes for you to use in your project! Sprinkle little details into your island or add full building prefabs to form towns and parks.

![Spline's asset library]()

> Here are some ideas for what to make for ya:
- A park
- A town in the wild west
- Your dream house or resort
- A space station
- Recreate a building from your favorite movie or video game
- Your school/the building you‚Äôre currently in

## Build a community world by linking islands üåâ
