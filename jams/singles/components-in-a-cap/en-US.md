## Running this workshop

_Not a club leader? You can [skip ahead](#intro)_

> This workshop will take about 60 minutes to design. After that, in a seperate 60 minute session you can order your board for manufacturing.

What do your club members need?

- Access to jlcpcb.com (check on your school's network!) & an account
- Drawing tools (figma is great for this, but other tools like ms paint online end up being really funny)
  - A pencil and paper work for this too, but digital is preferred!
- Creativity (this one's kinda on them)

As a bonus, **you** should have:

- A bunch of post-it notes or shreds of paper (around 2-3 per attendee)
- 2 funny looking hats (or equally funny container)
- Seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bumzyz2advg) of what it looks like to run this workshop
- 5 green balloons [^1]
<!-- - Made your own slides based on TODO: SLIDE LINK HERE -->

[^1]: (you don't really need this but I want to see if anyone tries getting them)

## Intro

> Appreciate the ends without understanding the means.

In this jam, you'll design a small trinket. Don't know what it is yet, but discovering it will be part of the activity.

Instead of "Learn to make a hacker card" or "Learn to make a digital level", we're going to make something perfectly useless!

## Random part picker!

> If you're a club leader, I'd encourage you to get 2 funny looking hats and label them "input" and "output". Then people can pick their components out of there.
>
> Someone won't quick talking during your presentation? Give'em a third componentâ€“ that'll keep them busy.

You're going to randomly select an input component and an output component.

> âœ‹ Stop right there! Are you an individual not in a club? it's ok, I don't have friends either. You can instead roll a virtual dice by googling "Roll d4". Also good if you have _internet friends_ and want to play a game of _internet dungeons & internet dragons_.

Here are some **inputs**:

1. Dial
2. Button
3. Switch
4. Light sensor

Here are some **outputs**:

1. Buzzer (like a speaker but more annoying)
2. LED (for lighting!)
3. Rumble motor (what makes your Switch Controller feel alive)

Here are some source of **power**:

1. Battery
2. USB (type-a or type-c)

Why not take a personality test while we're at it. Here are some houses: [^0]

[^0]: idk, i've never actually ready hairy otter

1. snakepeople
2. huff'n stuff
3. rarvencaw
4. griffydoor

Now you're going to make this into a project by putting your components together.

> ðŸ¤” Hmmm, how do I make something with my components?

#### Examples

1. I got a dial and an LEDâ€“ I'll make a flashlight, but instead of an on/off button, it has a dial
2. I got a light sensor and a rumble motor. I'll make an annoying wrist watch to wake me up in the morning b/c an apple watch is too expensive

### No problems, Only solutions

Your pitches are going to be solutions to things that aren't problems. It's kinda like web3. That's a good thing though!

No one has ever sat down to learn web dev & made the next facebook. Similarly, if you sit down thinking "I'm going to make something as helpful as an iPhone", you're destined for failure.

> Hey there club leader! If someone makes a good pitch you can award their house 10 points. Points don't really matter, but they don't _not_ matter. Go ahead and think about that.

## Shopping spree

You can search for parts on [lcsc.com](https://lcsc.com) by typing their part number into the search bar. We aren't going to buy them yet, but you can do this to get a sense of the size of the part you're going to get.

Do this to get a good idea of your parts. Are they big or small? Transparent or colorful?

## Form over function!

Now that you have your parts, let's design what the board looks like!

Use your art tool of choice (figma / mspaint / crayola / photoshop /finger paints) to draw what you want your board to look like.

Make a shape for the board you like, and kinda lay it all out in the editor of your choice.

## Intermission

If you're in a club, now's a good time to take a break. If you're not, you can take a break too. I'm a website, not your mom.
